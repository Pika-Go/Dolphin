# Dolphin

Dolphin is a Game Engine to develop 2D and 3D games fast and easy and written in Go. The goal is to allow very fast development, which is often needed in prototyping.
Thanks to the many embedded open-source libraries we can provide you with all the features you might need. Keep in mind that we aim for a miniamlistic and compact game engine.

#### 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

Dolphin Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and
3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common
tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the
wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including
the major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows) as well as mobile
(Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.

#### Free, open source and community-driven

Dolphin is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Dolphin's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the Software Freedom Conservancy not-for-profit.
